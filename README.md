# Overview
This is a full-stack e-commerce application designed to provide a practical learning experience. The application allows users to purchase sneakers and is built using both front-end and back-end development techniques. The primary goal was to gain a deeper understanding of web development and to create a functional and well-designed e-commerce application from scratch.

# Technologies
* **React for the front-end user interface**
* **.NET Web API framework for the back-end API development**
* **SQL for the database management**
* **Redux store for states management**
* **Utilizing SCSS for efficient and scalable styling**

# Key Features
* User authentication using JWT tokens for ```secure login```
* Dynamic pricing and inventory management
* Easy-to-use and ```intuitive interface``` for seamless shopping experience
* Filtering and sorting options: search by keyword, sort by newest and oldest, and filter by size and price range
* Integration with PayPal for ```secure payment processing```
* Cart and wishlist items are saved in local storage for convenience

# To Do
* **Integrate additional payment methods such as Stripe**
* **Enhance the application's responsiveness for smaller screens**
* **Address minor bugs and improve code readability**
* **Implement guest checkout and edit/register users with password hashing for better security.**

In a larger project, separating the shipping and user tables would allow for easier implementation of guest checkout and greater flexibility in managing a user's shipping details. As part of planned improvements, the application could also benefit from a separate table for brands to simplify filtering by brand and further abstraction of the database for better scalability.

# Conclusion
This project allowed me to combine my knowledge of SQL and C# with self-taught front-end skills and learn about web API frameworks and development, HTTP methods, and Redux for store management. I also learned how to develop endpoints for the back-end API, which enabled communication with the front-end user interface. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of full-stack development and how to incorporate SQL and databases into a larger project. The planned improvements will further enhance the application's functionality, security, and user experience.
